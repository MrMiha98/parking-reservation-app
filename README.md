## 🧰 How It Works

# Starting as a new user
- The parking layout consists of 2 floors
- Every parking spot consists of a parking spot number and a name of the person that currently has the spot reserved
- Green and red colors are used to visualise the status of the spot, red meaning "RESERVED" and green meaning "FREE"
- The main background color of a spot indicates the availability status for today
- The little triangle in the top right corner indicates the availability status for tommorow

# Starting as a new user
- Every new user need to register and confirm an link that is send to the selected email address
- After a successfull cofirmation the user is greeted with a modal
- The modal allows the user to pick a number (number = parking spot number) if they own a parking spot
- or the option "I Dont Own A Parking Spot" if they do not own a parking spot
- After that the role and the selected spot is inserted into the database

# Owners workflow
- Owners can select the free up button and free up their parking spot by selecting the wanted dates and confirming by clicking the button
- In case the owner changes their mind, they can reverse the freed up reservation by selecting the trash big icon and selecting the dates they want to keep their spot locked

# Spotless Users Workflow
- Users can click on any spot they want and are shown a calendar that shows the dates the selected spot is free
- Free days are marked as green and are selectable
- The unavailable days are unselectable
- The user can select the dates they wish to reserve the spot and confirm using the button
- The reservation is then inserted into the database

## 🗄️ Backend

- 2 services: Auth and Database

  # Auth
- Every new user is inserted into the Authentication table and give a unique id, email and password

  # Database
- In the Database part, there are 3 tables;
